# Introduction

In this week's lab,, you will find one additional dataset that is completely new to you. You will use your expertise and knowledge as a Data Scientist to analyze this data and then communicate conclusions, recommendations, and findings related to interesting questions answered from the data. 

Make sure you also revisit Lab 2 to reflect on how well you have accomplished your team and individual goals.

# Datasets

Here we present a list of websites that contain potential datasets to use.

* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)  
* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)  
* [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)  
* [BuzzFeed](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews)

# Tools

You have been studyinging Data Science for over 15 weeks! Using R, you are now able to effectively perform:

1. Data Visualization  
2. Data Wrangling  
3. Summary Statistics  
4. Permutation Tests  
5. Linear Modeling  

Did I miss anything?

# Conclusion

Y'all are blossoming into effective Data Scientists. For those of you that decide to continue this career path, note that this is only the beginning. Here is a picture that I took from [this website](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-long-term-data-science-roadmap-which-wont-help-you-become-an-expert-in-only-several-months-4436733e63ff) that summarizes the different skills you need as a Data Scientist.
